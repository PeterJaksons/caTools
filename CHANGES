Changes:
1) caMassClass-1.0 to caTools-1.0 - caTools created after splitting caMassClass
   package:
  - bin2raw and raw2bin files: endian variable was added
  - raw2bin: additional error checking
  - runmean, runmax, runmin, runquantile, runmad: additional error checking and
    corrected error checking
  - EndRule: added error checking
  - runmean, runmax, runmin: additional parameter "alg" was added
  - runmean - new C code can survive round-off errors
2) caTools-1.1  (7/15/2005)
  - read.GIF and write.GIF files were added.
  - bin2raw and raw2bin files: much faster raw to numeric conversion
  - sum.exact, cumsum.exact and runsum.exact  functions were added for 
    under-flow safe addition.
3) caTools-1.2 (8/8/2005)
  - minor changes to .Rd files to fix problems found by new 'checkDocFiles'
    function.
4) caTools-1.3 (9/23/2005)
  - changes to colAUC function. Parameters: plotROC and alg were added. 
    Parameter 'p.val' was removed, since it gave wrong results in case of data 
    with ties. And it was too complicated to fix.
  - added much better testing of "colAUC" in Example section.
