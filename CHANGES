    corrected error checking
  - EndRule: added error checking
  - runmean, runmax, runmin: additional parameter "alg" was added
  - runmean - new C code can survive round-off errors
2) caTools-1.0 to caTools-1.1 :
  - read.GIF and write.GIF files were added.
  - bin2raw and raw2bin files: much faster raw to numeric conversion
  - sum.exact, cumsum.exact and runsum.exact  functions were added for
