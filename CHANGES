Changes:
1) caMassClass-1.0 to caTools-1.0 - caTools created after splitting caMassClass
   package:
  - bin2raw and raw2bin files: endian variable was added
  - raw2bin: additional error checking
  - runmean, runmax, runmin, runquantile, runmad: additional error checking and
    corrected error checking
  - EndRule: added error checking
  - runmean, runmax, runmin: additional parameter "alg" was added
  - runmean - new C code can survive round-off errors
2) caTools-1.1  (7/15/2005)
  - read.GIF and write.GIF files were added.
  - bin2raw and raw2bin files: much faster raw to numeric conversion
  - sum.exact, cumsum.exact and runsum.exact  functions were added for 
    under-flow safe addition.
3) caTools-1.2 (8/8/2005)
  - minor changes to .Rd files to fix problems found by new 'checkDocFiles'
    function.
4) caTools-1.3 (9/23/2005)
  - changes to colAUC function. Parameters: plotROC and alg were added. 
    Parameter 'p.val' was removed, since it gave wrong results in case of data 
    with ties. And it was too complicated to fix.
  - added much better testing of "colAUC" in Example section.
4) caTools-1.4 (9/28/2005)
  - a small change in 1.3 that used call to 'max' instead of 'pmax' made 
    'colAUC' return wrong numbers in case of multi-feature data.
5) caTools-1.5 (11/10/2005)
  - several new examples
  - functions raw2bin and bin2raw still work but return warnings. They will be 
    retired in the next version, since they parallel new capabilities of 
    readBin and writeBin.
  - Argument 'col' of function 'write.gif' was changed to allow several other 
    ways to define a color palette.
  - base64encode and base64decode now use readBin and writeBin instead
    raw2bin and bin2raw.
 6) caTools-1.6 (04/11/2006)
  - functions raw2bin and bin2raw were retired, since they parallel new 
    (as of R-2.2.0) capabilities of readBin and writeBin.
  - Bug in plotting in colAUC function was fixed, after it was reported by Tom 
    Wright.
  - Documentation of colAUC was updated and some examples modified in order to 
    reduce dependency on external libraries.
  - GifTools.cc was split into GifTools.cpp and GifTools.cc. The first file
    contains GIF encoding/decoding algorithm and second is a shell that 
    comunicates with R.
